# FastHTML Todo Application Guide

> A guide to using the Todo application with nbdev and FastHTML

## Introduction

This is a simple Todo application built with FastHTML and nbdev. It
demonstrates how to structure a FastHTML application using nbdev’s
notebook-based development approach.

## Getting Started

To run the application:

Copy from app import run_app

run_app()

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several modules:

- **core**: Core utilities and configurations
- **db**: Database models and operations
- **components**: UI components for rendering Todos
- **auth**: Authentication functionality
- **todos**: Todo management routes
- **app**: Main application assembly

## Features

- User authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete Todos
- Drag and drop reordering of Todos
- Markdown support in Todo details

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with FastLite, which supports the
MiniDataAPI spec:

Copy from db import db, Todo, User

Database tables print(f”Tables: {list(db.t.keys())}“)

Todo schema print(f”Todo fields: {Todo.annotations}“)

## Authentication

Authentication is handled with session-based auth and Beforeware:

Copy from auth import before, login_redir

The beforeware checks if a user is authenticated and redirects to login
if not

## Todo Management

The main functionality is in the todos module:

Copy from todos import todo_routes

Routes include: GET / - Main todo list POST / - Create new todo PUT / -
Update todo DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete todo GET /todos/{id} - View todo
details GET /edit/{id} - Edit todo form

## Extending the Application

To add new features, create a new notebook with appropriate routes and
import it in app.ipynb.

## Deployment

To deploy this application:

1.  Export the nbdev project
2.  Run the main app module

``` python
nbdev_export python -m todo_app.app
```
